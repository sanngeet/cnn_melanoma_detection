# Melanoma Detection

> To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information

- Provide general information about your project here.
  - build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
  - A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
- What is the dataset that is being used?
  - The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.

## Conclusions

- Conclusion 1 from the analysis
  - The model is an overfit.
- Conclusion 2 from the analysis
  - After image augmentatioin, the model accuracy has increased.
- Conclusion 3 from the analysis
  - After using image augmentor, the model accuracy is further increased, but now the model is underfit.
- The model performance can be improved by adding more layers and removing dropout layers, and by tuning the hyperparameters.
